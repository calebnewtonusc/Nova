# The landscape

Every tool worth knowing about, with real numbers. Star counts and licenses pulled from
the GitHub API on **2026-09-04**. Sorted by layer, then by whether I would actually
reach for it.

The verdict column is the point. Star count is not a recommendation.

## Reading the table

**The four to install** are Peekaboo, agent-desktop, cliclick, and macos-automator-mcp.
Together they cover layers 2 through 5 with the accessibility tree as the default and
vision as the fallback, which is the correct architecture. That is what `install.sh`
does.

**The three worth reading even if you never install them** are OpenAdapt (demonstration
compiled to a verified program, the only project treating reliability as the primary
problem), clawdcursor (AX + OCR fused into one addressable map with a single safety
gate), and Anthropic's `computer-use-demo` (the canonical loop, in under a thousand
lines).

**What almost everything gets wrong on macOS:** it is ported from a cross-platform
design where vision is the only universal option, so vision becomes the default here
too. On a Mac that is leaving a free, fast, structured API on the table.
